## Hey, I'm Felipe 👋

I like to build cool things!

Co-Founder at **RanqIA**, Fellow Estudar '25, and Behring Scholar '25. Currently studying Computer Science at **Insper** (São Paulo, Brazil) with a full non-refundable scholarship.

My journey started in middle school at UFAL — automating boring tasks, then doing actual research. Since then I've gone through academia, startups, and now founding my own company.
