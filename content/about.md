## Hey, I'm Felipe 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at **Insper** (São Paulo, Brazil), with a deep passion for web scraping, AI applications, and building tools that make real-world workflows faster and smarter.

My journey started in middle school, automating boring tasks with Python scripts. Since then, I've gone through competitive programming, academic research, university teaching, and production-level software development.
